## P1stream

This is early work on a utility to livestream your desktop and camera sources
on a Mac. But it's far from usable at this point.

    git clone https://github.com/stephank/P1stream.git
    cd P1stream
    git submodule update --init
    xcodebuild -workspace P1stream.xcworkspace -scheme P1stream

All original code here is licensed [GPLv3](LICENSE). This is pretty much
everything in this repository (not submodules) except the contents of the
`generated` directories, which is based on their respective projects.
